<!-- GOOD START -->
It's way overkill except for practicing compiling SASS. Would probably be better practice to work on some files from scratch for that.

This really would be much easier to just use CDN's for everything (except maybe custom style overides, which is still pretty useful). But at the very least, I had a successful run with gulp again. I have a better understanding of how to set it up and watch ... and I have a repo with all of the templates and css in one place.

Stick with JS and React tutorials for now, it's more valuable to an employer.
